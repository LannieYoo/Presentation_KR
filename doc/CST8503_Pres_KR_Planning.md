# CST8503 Presentation: Knowledge Representation and Planning

## Group Formation

Form a group of 3 or 4 members, and have one person from the group submit the names to Brightspace under this assignment, as soon as you have formed a group. After presenting, each member will additionally submit their peer review spreadsheet, and one member of each group will submit the presentation materials (slide deck, video, other documents).

## Peer Review Spreadsheet

After the group formation has finished, a spreadsheet for peer reviewing will be posted to Brightspace, already populated with group name lists.

## Overview

Planning courses of action to achieve a goal is one of the important problem categories of Artificial Intelligence. We have been studying how to use Knowledge Representation and Prolog to solve planning problems. Using your experience so far, you will work with a team of students to create an educational presentation to help yourselves and other students of the topic.

## Activity

Working in groups of 3-4 members, create an educational presentation (7 to 12 minutes long) on the subject of solving Planning problems with Knowledge Representation and Prolog. Video format or live presentation format are both acceptable. In lab class, we will view the presentations as a group, and each student will participate in the grading by assigning a score to each presentation including your own. Furthermore, you will also assign a score to each member of your own group.

## Content Guidelines

The presentation or video should be based the actual experience of the team members, and dedicated to using that experience to help a future student learn how to solve planning problems with Prolog. While adhering to the 7-12 minute time boundaries, you are free to design your presentation to give a broad overview of helpful information, or alternatively, your team can concentrate on a smaller number of topics that you feel are most important to address to ensure learning success for students.

Example appropriate topics (not limited to these):

What is Knowledge Representation

How is it different from Machine Learning?

What kinds of problems benefit from KR?

What makes KR suitable for planning problems?

What is the planning problem in Artificial Intelligence?

What are the main approaches to solving the planning problem?

How is KR suited to solving the planning problem?

Prolog solutions to the planning problem

Why is Prolog suitable for solving planning problems?

What steps can a student take to ramping up on planning with Prolog?

How does depth-first vs breadth-first search affect planning Systems?

Planning problem Case Study

Present an example planning problem

What are recommended steps for solving the problem.

Demonstrate a solution to the problem

Advice for classmates learning planning with Prolog

Tips and Tricks for success

Potential pitfalls to avoid while learning Prolog

## Methodology

It is important to decide early on strategy and an outline of what the content of your presentation will be. Begin by meeting as a group to take inventory of each group member's experiences and thoughts on solving planning problems. Design the content of your presentation to be representative of your group. Try to take advantage of your student's-eye-view. The possibilities are open, but here are some examples strategies your group might choose for a basis of your presentation:

If one or more members of your group is struggling with planning or one of its concepts, and one or more members of your group feels quite confident, then that is a golden opportunity to make your presentation about how the group members worked with each other on overcoming some of the struggles. The confident members can bring to the table advice, studying strategies, tutoring attempts, etc, and the struggling members can bring to the table verification of what seems to work well, and what doesn't seem to work as well, and why.

If all of your group members are confident and learning how to solve planning problems is going well for everyone, then that is a golden opportunity to pick one or two of the really difficult topics relating to planning, and explain it in more detail than you have so far. Why is it difficult? Why is it important? How can an understanding of the topic make you a better software developer?

If all of your group members are struggling with planning, then that is a golden opportunity to make a presentation about the details of the struggles that students might face when trying to learn how to solve planning problems. Compare notes with your team-mates on what are the most daunting concepts, and why they are daunting compared to what you are used to.

## Delivery of Presentation

Each group member must do some speaking in the video or during the live presentation, depending on which of those two formats you have chosen. While you are speaking (or being recorded for video) you are representing, from your own point of view, your contribution to the tutorial and advice your team is providing to future students.

We will watch all the presentations together in a dedicated Lab, and each student will assign a peer-review grade to each group including their own, as well as a peer-review grade to each member of their own group (including themselves).

## Grading

Your grade for the presentation will be calculated as a combination of the average peer-assigned grade, with potential adjustments by the professor.
