## Opening (10 seconds)

Hello everyone. I want to share some tips for working with Knowledge Representation and planning in Prolog.

## What Students Find Hard (20 seconds)

So, what do students find hard? Well, there are four main things.

First, thinking about the world as states, not step-by-step instructions. Students are used to thinking step by step, but planning needs you to think about what the world looks like at each moment.

Next, remembering all the rules. For each action, you need to remember what must be true before, what changes after, and what stays the same. There are too many rules.

Third, when the computer can't find a plan, students don't know why. The computer doesn't tell you what's wrong.

And last, finding mistakes in Prolog code is really hard. You need to check every rule and every condition, and it takes a lot of time.

So, how can we fix these problems?

## Helpful Tips (70 seconds)

I have six tips that can help.

**First tip: Start small.** You can use just two places instead of five, or two objects instead of ten. Once it works, then you can add more.

**Second tip: Draw pictures.** You can draw each situation on paper. You can use arrows to show what changes. This helps you see what needs to be true before an action and what changes after.

**Third tip: Write things down first.** It's good to list all your objects, places, and facts before writing code. You can make a simple table. This helps you organize your thoughts.

**Fourth tip: Think step by step.** For each action, you can think about: What must be true before? What changes after? What stays the same? If you can explain it like a story, writing the code becomes much easier.

**Fifth tip: Test one thing at a time.** It's better to test single actions first, not the whole plan. This helps you find mistakes quickly.

**Sixth tip: Use good names.** Instead of writing "a r 1", you can write "at robot l1". Good names make your code easier to read.

## Common Mistakes (10 seconds)

And one more thing. Many students forget about "NOT" rules. Some actions need something to be NOT true. For example, the monkey can only move if it is NOT on the box. But students often forget this. So when you write your code, check both what must be true AND what must be false.

I hope these tips help you work better with Knowledge Representation and planning. 

Thank you.
